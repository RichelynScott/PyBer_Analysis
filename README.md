# PyBer_Analysis
#### MOD 5 - Rideshare Visualization &amp; MatPlotLib

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze and display a subset of data in an easier way to visualize data using MatPlotLib via us and knowledge of Python, Panda, and Jupyter Notebook. We were delving deep into the data from a ridesharing company called PyBer whose data we categorized out by the 3 city types: Rural, Urban, and Suburban. We first used Panda functions such as Groupby(), Count(), & Sum() to get the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each of the 3 city types. Once that information was available we proceeded to use that data to make useful calculations: average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each of the 3 city types. We the used those data sets to ultimately create a new data frame that told us the average fare per week for each of the 3 city types from January 1st, 2019 through April 29th, 2019. This data frame was then used to produce a visualization of said data into a multiple-ling graph using “pivot()” , “.loc”, “.index”, “.sum”, & “.resample” functions to display the changes in fare price (measured in $USD) from 1-1-2019 to 4-29-2019 in increments of 1 week for each of the 3 city types (Rural, Urban, & Suburban)---making our goal of summarizing how the data highlights differences by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer such as V. Isualize who has entrusted us with such an important analysis.

## Results

The table/dataframe below was a crucial display of the analysis we performed to be able to compare key metrics amongst the 3 city types- Rural, Suburban, and Urban:

This dataset provides us with a lot of valuable information that the company, PyBer, can use effectively to understand its different markets. The majority of the rides occur in the more densely populated city type, Urban, with 1625 total rides, whereas suburban only have 625 rides, and rural with only 125 rides in this time frame. Along with the largest number of rides and obviously drivers as well—this city type generates the most revenue bringing in $39,854.38 which is more than twice the revenue generated by Suburban rides and even greater than the revenues of both rural and suburban rides combined! It is however important to note that on average both rural and suburban rides do generate more revenue per ride than Urban rides possibly due to longer trips being more normal in rural areas vs how close together most things are in an urban city type; nonetheless, important to note that rural drivers tend to make more money per ride/trip, and since there are also less drivers- the average fare per driver is also much higher than the others. 

We created a multiple line chart to help visualize and perform analysis of the Total Fares from January 1st, 2019 to April 29th 2019 for each of the 3 city types:

Overall in this time frame from January to April the overall fares have only changed marginally with the greatest gains showing in urban and suburban rides respectively. There was a moment from January to February that all areas saw a slight increase in fares, but besides that there were only 2 moments at the end of February and the end of March that both rural and urban saw its biggest increases from the previous weeks, it would be good to find out what was the cause of the event and how they can attempt to also maximize suburban areas during those times as well. 

## Summary

From our data and analysis we generated we are able to see the key differences between the 3 city types. Urban cities seem to be the greatest revenue generating area over Suburban and rural areas. As the best performing city type of the 3, it may make sense to invest more in these areas to continue to grow the revenue in those areas. That is not to say that rural and suburban areas are to be ignored, but rather seen as slower growing markets. Fares tend to be higher in these areas, so it may be interesting to see if adjusting fare prices in those areas would have any effect on the total number of fares and revenues for those city types.
