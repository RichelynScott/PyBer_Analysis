# PyBer_Analysis
#### MOD 5 - Rideshare Visualization &amp; MatPlotLib

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze and display a subset of data in an easier way to visualize data using MatPlotLib via us and knowledge of Python, Panda, and Jupyter Notebook. We were delving deep into the data from a ridesharing company called PyBer whose data we categorized out by the 3 city types: Rural, Urban, and Suburban. We first used Panda functions such as Groupby(), Count(), & Sum() to get the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each of the 3 city types. Once that information was available we proceeded to use that data to make useful calculations: average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each of the 3 city types. We the used those data sets to ultimately create a new data frame that told us the average fare per week for each of the 3 city types from January 1st, 2019 through April 29th, 2019. This data frame was then used to produce a visualization of said data into a multiple-ling graph using “pivot()” , “.loc”, “.index”, “.sum”, & “.resample” functions to display the changes in fare price (measured in $USD) from 1-1-2019 to 4-29-2019 in increments of 1 week for each of the 3 city types (Rural, Urban, & Suburban)---making our goal of summarizing how the data highlights differences by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer such as V. Isualize who has entrusted us with such an important analysis.
